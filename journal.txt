Today I tried to work on the error I was 
getting related to HTTP implementation which 
was because of the handle response functions.
The program was not able to reply with sticker
or any other document.

I decided to take a look at Telegram documentation
for this issue and I realized python does not have 
the ability to differentiate the functions with the 
same name (overloading).

I am now using chat-gpt to learn about each functions
that i am supposed to use in order to make them work:
updater needs dispatcher in order to decide which handler 
function to use based on the content.
